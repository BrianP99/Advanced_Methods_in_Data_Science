# Methods_in_Data_Science

Welcome to my repository! Here you'll find a collection of my work from Informatics courses at the University of Washington. The repository is divided into two main sections: Core Methods and Advanced Methods.

In the Core Methods section, I cover essential topics such as data ingestion, cloud computing, statistical inference, machine learning, information visualization, and data ethics. Each of these topics is crucial to building a strong foundation in data science.

In the Advanced Methods section, I explore more advanced techniques in supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as methods for experimental design and causal inference. These topics are critical for solving complex data science problems and conducting meaningful research.
