# Methods_in_Data_Science

Welcome to the "Methods_in_Data_Science" repository! 

Here you'll find a collection of all my works from Informatics courses at the University of Washington. <img src="uw_logo.png" alt="uw logo" width="25" height="17"> The repository has two main sections: **Core Methods and Advanced Methods.**

In the Core Methods section, I cover essential topics such as data ingestion, cloud computing, statistical inference, machine learning, information visualization, and data ethics. Each topic is crucial to building a strong foundation in data science.

In the Advanced Methods section, I explore more advanced techniques in supervised and unsupervised machine learning and methods for experimental design and causal inference. These topics are critical for solving complex data science problems and conducting meaningful research.
