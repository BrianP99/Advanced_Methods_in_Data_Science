# Methods_in_Data_Science

This repository contains all the work that I have done in my classes of major. In core methods, it includes data ingestion, cloud computing, statistical inference, machine learning, information visualization, and data ethics. In advanced methods, it includes a survey of common techniques in supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and methods for experimental design and causal inference
