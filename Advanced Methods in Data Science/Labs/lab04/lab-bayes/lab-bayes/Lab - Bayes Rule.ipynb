    "The data **house-votes-84-yeas** contains votes for 16 bills by 435 Representatives in 1984. The US Congress consists of two chambers: The House of Representatives (or just ''House''), and Senate.  There are 435 members---Representatives (or just Rep-s) in the House.  Almost all Reps are members of either Democratic or Republican party.\n",
    "\n",

    "The variables **yea1--yea16** are coded in a way that ''1''\n",
